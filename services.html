            <h3>Kitchen</h3>
            <p>We think of the kitchen as the centerpiece of a house
                I am sure we are not the only ones who realize that almost every house in Denver was built in the early
                1900’s. That being said, it is very common to see kitchens with outdated appliances, cabinets that do
                not meet your style standards, and kitchens that are closed off from the rest of the house. It is the
                21st century. Let Facelift Remodeling modernize your kitchen with your ideas and our precise execution.
                <br><br>
                <b>We specialize in:</b>
                <ul>
                    <li><b>Design:</b> Modern, traditional, and rustic are our bread and butter but are open to just
